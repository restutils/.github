# Welcome to RESTUtils

More than likely you're here for the RESTUtils Host; a small utility that instantly converts any JavaScript library or Node package into a web-based REST API.  Here's a quick video showing how to use it:

[![RESTUtils Host Demo](https://github.com/restutils/restutils-host/raw/main/docs/images/thumb.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfu1ubVC3gg)

There's also a new client generator, called... of course... [RESTUtils Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restutils-client)... which will hunt down the APIs you create with [RESTUtils Host](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restutils-host) and build a local client library with all of your methods so you can simply reference one file to access all of them.

Aaaand, I'm currently working a utility package that will help add some clever little helper functions for things like error handling and the like.  Once that is published I'll record a few more videos to show how to quickly build out a microservice solution using all of them.

Should you run into any snags, or have questions, feel free to reach out: [info@restutils.com](mailto:info@restutils.com)

Until then, have a great day!

Thanx,  
Fred
