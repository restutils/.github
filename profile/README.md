# Welcome to RESTUtils

More than likely you're here for the RESTUtils Host; a small utility that instantly converts any JavaScript library or Node package into a web-based REST API.  Here's a quick video showing how to use it:

Should you run into any snags, or have questions, feel free to reach out: [info@restutils.com](mailto:info@restutils.com)

Until then, have a great day!

Thanx,
